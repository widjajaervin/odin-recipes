        <h3><p>Description</p></h3>
        <p>This stir-fry of rice noodles and ground pork gives Pad Thai a serious run for its money. Pad kee mao translates loosely to “drunken noodles,” though there’s no alcohol here — just an easy-to-assemble dish that skews salty, sour and spicy from a glaze of fish sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar and fresh chiles. Fatty ground pork imparts a lot of flavor, though you could swap in ground chicken or even firm tofu. If you’re sensitive to heat, leave out the smashed chiles, to finish — and add a pinch of sugar to offset the salty punch of the dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>5 bird’s eye chiles</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced onion</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced bell peppers</li>
            <li>12 ounces fresh rice noodles</li>
            <li>2 handfuls holy basil leaves (or Thai basil, in a pinch)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>Step 1</p>
            <li>Whisk together the fish sauce, soy sauce and vinegar, and set aside. Roughly chop the garlic and three chiles together. Smash the remaining two chiles using the flat of a knife, and set aside.
            </li>
            <p>Step 2</p>
            <li>Heat a wok (or a large frying pan over medium-high. When it’s hot, add the oil, the chopped garlic and chiles, and the onion. Cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the pork and a splash of the fish sauce mixture. Cook, stirring to break up the meat, until the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <p>Step 3</p>
            <li>Add the bell peppers and noodles, turn the heat to high and add almost all of the sauce (save a spoonful or two to add later, if needed). Cook, tossing everything together and separating the noodles if necessary, until the noodles are coated in sauce and take on a slightly charred flavor from the wok. Taste, and add more sauce if needed. Toss in the basil and the smashed chiles, and serve immediately.
            </li>
            <p>Step 4</p>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
